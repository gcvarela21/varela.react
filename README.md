### **Summary**

Using Bootstrap's grid I was able to use the utility items such as flex, layout gutters and columns, break points, and nav bars to build this site. Using reference images and specified break points I was able to recreate the sample on a live web setting hosted on git hub, using git commands from gitBash to add, commit, and push code from my personal computer onto gitHub's server for version control.

**About**

```html
Throughout my life, I’ve always been a hands-on person who is constantly learning new skills. 

While studying Visual Arts in Southern California I worked part-time as a handyman and cable technician. 

Although these roles were vastly different from what I was studying in school, I learned a lot about problem-solving, creative thinking, and troubleshooting.

These became the building blocks that sparked a curiosity for me to move into digital design.

I transferred to Cal State East Bay where I continued my studies in UX Design. The various classes I took there opened me up to more opportunities to learn new programs and tools. 

Upon Completing my course work for my BFA, in UX Design Fall of 2020, I decided to further my skills and training at the University of California Berkeley’s Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. 

As a Future Digital Designer, I’ve found a place where I can balance both my love for visual design with the problem-solving skills needed front and back-end web developement and design.
