                    <p>We began to tackle this project at a time when stress was high in our immediate and larger communities.
                    For this reason, we wanted to build a web app that could bring some joy and optimism to the User.Music is
                    loved by many and is a cornerstone of culture around the world, so we decided on an app that would help the
                    User
                    find more good stuff to listen to.

                        Last.fm is an online music service that allows users to track and share their listening history. Last.fm
                        consolidates their user data to examine broad popularity trends that we can access through their API. We
                        wanted to harness this data in combination with Google Maps in a practical way we had not seen before. This
                        was accomplished with jQuery, 3 APIs, and a CSS grid system.

                        One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it
                        (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of
                        standards or implement a new technology. In this homework, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an
                        existing site to make it more accessible.

                    <p>
                        Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with
                        disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and
                        braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them
                        being
                        that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid
                        litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
